UCL FILESYSTEM
==============

Augments the R6RS filesystem interactions with a few extra functions.

SYMLINK target name
  Create a symbolic link at NAME, which will point to TARGET

MKDIR path
  Create a directory at PATH

MKPATH path
  Create a directory tree at PATH. Equivalent to the 'mkdir -p' shell command

REMOVE-DIR path
  Remove a directory at PATH, but only if empty. Errors out otherwise.

REMOVE-RECURSIVE path
  Remove a directory and its contents at PATH.

DIR-CONTENTS path
  List the contents of PATH. Does not include "." or "..", but does include
  any other dotfiles.

PATH-EXISTS? path
  Returns true if something exists at PATH, regardless of type. In all schemes
  other than PLT, this should be identical to FILE-EXISTS?

PATH-FILE? path
  Returns true *only* if the 'something' at PATH is a file and not a directory

PATH-DIR? path
  Like PATH-FILE?, but for directories instead of files.
